# Pipeline pattern

Pipeline pattern in go involves chaining together a series of stages, where each stage performs a specific operation on data nad passes the processed data to the next stage. This pattern allows to the efficient processing of data in a sequential manner, with each stage handling a disticnt task.

Implementing a pipeline typically involves using goroutines and channels to connect stages together, allowing for concurrent execution and data flow between stages. A series of stages where data flows through each stage, often implementd using channels. each stage performs a specific transformation or operation on the data before passing it to the next stage.

You can extend this pattern by adding more stages or performing different operations within each stage, enabling efficient and concurrent data processing in controlled sequence.
