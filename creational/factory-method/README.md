# Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern introduces a novel concept, creating objects without having to specify their exact types. This pattern allows developers to encapsulate the process of object creation, abstracting it behind a common interface or base class. Subclasses or implementations of this interface furnish the necessary creation logic, enabling clients to generate objects without delving into intricate implementation details.
