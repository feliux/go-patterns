# Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an abstraction over object construction. Instead of directly constructing an object with a large number of constructor arguments, the pattern splits the construction process into multiple smaller steps. Each step is handled by a separate builder, which allows for greater flexibility and configurability.
